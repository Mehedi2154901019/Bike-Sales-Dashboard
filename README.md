# Bike Sales Dashboard | Excel Project

This project is an end-to-end **Data Analysis and Dashboard Visualization** solution developed entirely in **Microsoft Excel**. While Power BI and Python are often go-to tools for data analytics, this project explores Excel’s powerful capabilities to perform **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, **feature engineering**, and **interactive visualization**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze bike sales data, extract meaningful insights, and visualize patterns through a fully interactive Excel dashboard — without using any external BI or programming tools.

## 📁 Project Structure

The Excel file contains **four structured sheets**:

1. **`Dataset`**
   - Contains the original raw dataset.
   - No modifications; used as the foundation.

2. **`Working Sheet`**
   - Copy of the original data used for:
     - Cleaning
     - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
     - Feature Engineering (e.g., age grouping)

3. **`Pivot Table`**
   - Core data aggregations using Excel Pivot Tables.
   - Supports dynamic filtering and cross-tabulation.

4. **`Dashboard`**
   - Final interactive visualizations.
   - Includes charts, slicers, filters, and summary metrics.
